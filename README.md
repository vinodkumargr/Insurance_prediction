# Insurance Premium Prediction

This project focuses on predicting insurance premiums using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately estimates insurance premiums based on various factors related to the policyholder's demographics, medical history, and lifestyle.

## Introduction

Insurance companies use a variety of factors to determine the risk profile of an individual and calculate appropriate insurance premiums. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that estimates insurance premiums for policyholders.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical insurance data, including information about policyholders and their corresponding insurance premiums. The dataset is a collection of structured data, providing a comprehensive view of the policyholders' characteristics and the premiums charged.

## Features

The dataset includes a range of features that could potentially influence insurance premiums. Some of the features considered in the model development include:

- Age: The age of the policyholder.
- Gender: The gender of the policyholder.
- BMI: The Body Mass Index of the policyholder.
- Medical History: Details about the policyholder's pre-existing medical conditions.
- Lifestyle Factors: Information about the policyholder's smoking habits, exercise routine, etc.
- Coverage Type: The type and level of coverage selected by the policyholder.

## Model Development

To develop the predictive model, we employ various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

During the model development phase, we preprocess the data, handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and select relevant features for training the model. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques are employed to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts insurance premiums and quantify the average difference between predicted and actual values.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:
